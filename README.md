# Gologic

A port of core minikanren with inequality to Go based on doctor Byrd's
thesis.

Provides reasoning over structs via Go's `reflect` package.

Provides a "database" in to which you can assert facts and then reason
over the facts in the database

## Usage

```go
a,b,c := Fresh3()
ch := Run(a,Or(And(Unify(a,b),Unify(b,c),Unify(c,1)),
               And(Unify(a,b),Unify(b,c),Unify(c,3))))
if 1 == <- ch {t.Fatal("not a 1")}
if 3 == <- ch {t.Fatal("not a 3")}
```

`gologic.Fresh()` returns a fresh unbound logic var. Fresh2-6 return
more logic vars at once.

`gologic.Run(...)` takes a logic var and a goal, and returns a channel
(type `chan interface{}`) in to which results will be placed.

provided goals constructors are:
  * `gologic.Unify(a,b)`
  * `gologic.Neq(a,b)`
  * `gologic.And(a,...)`
  * `gologic.Or(a,...)`

a goal is a `func (s S) R {...}`

a goal constructor is a function that returns a goal

See `gologic_test.go`

`zebra/zebra.go` has an example of solving the zebra puzzle ported from
Clojure's `core.logic`. You can run the example like:

```sh
go run zebra/zebra.go
```

`gologic.Call` is a goal constructor that is a useful helper for
constructing recursive goals, by delaying the recursive call to the
goal constructor until the logic program is being run. See `ancestoro`
in `gologic_test.go`

## Benchmarks

```sh
go test -bench '.*' 
```
